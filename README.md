# WTH is this?
Crumble is an interpreted alternative to Assembly. I made it because Assembly is unreadble.
# Why should I use this?
IDK, you choose.
# Give me an example.
Sure:
```
chunk variables
    hwstr "Hello,//World!"
chunk program
    out hwstr
```
See, 4 lines! Compared to 15 lines of pure Assembly.
